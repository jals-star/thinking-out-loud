# Thinking Out Loud  
Welcome to my personal learning journal. I write about whatever I’m currently studying or thinking about – from math, AI, and physics to history, coding, and self-improvement.  

Everything here is an attempt to explain what I’m learning to myself, following the Feynman principle: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
